## Hi there ğŸ‘‹

- ğŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning Autmoated Testing
- ğŸ¤” Iâ€™m looking for help with getting my tech career started. Tips for entering the "real-world" of tech?
- âš¡ Fun fact: Arthropods are my favorite pets! I currently have a scorpion and some beetles. Don't worry, I don't harbor bugs! These are true insects, not true bugs ğŸ¦‚
